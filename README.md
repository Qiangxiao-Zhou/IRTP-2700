# **Industrial Robot Trajectory-Power Dataset (IRTP-2700)**


This repository provides access to the IRTP-2700 dataset, which contains 2,700 samples. Each sample includes joint-level trajectory data and corresponding total power consumption of the 6-DOF industrial robots, collected under varying operating conditions (e.g., different loads, velocities, and accelerations). The dataset is intended to support research on energy consumption prediction and optimization for industrial robots.
