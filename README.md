# **Industrial Robot Trajectory-Power Dataset (IRTP-2700)**

This repository provides access to the IRTP-2700 dataset, a curated collection of 2,700 trajectory-power samples collected from a physical 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) industrial robotic platform under various operating conditions (including different loads, velocities, and accelerations). The dataset is designed to support research on energy consumption (EC) prediction and optimization for industrial robots.
